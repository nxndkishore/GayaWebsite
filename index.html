      <li>Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life. It is a movement from  darkness to light. Without education, people get caught in the inter-generational cycles of poverty and backwardness. Seven decades have passed after independence but still, India struggles to achieve a literacy rate of over 90 per cent. Providing quality education to all children of India should be the top priority of both the State and Central governments. And thus, the different departments of the Government of India often support charities to bring more and more children under the ambit of their education initiatives.</li>
